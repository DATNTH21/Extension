//                     Simulate user interactions (clicks, inputs, gestures, keyboard navigation, etc.).
//                     Include assertions to verify expected UI behavior.
//                     Manage asynchronous operations (e.g., animations, loading states, delayed UI updates).

//                     Mock API responses to test UI behavior under different conditions (success, failure, timeout).
//                     Follow best practices for the selected testing tool and language.
