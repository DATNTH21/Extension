This is testing code: 
{code}
Given a block of code in any programming language, identify and return all lines that involve mocking or stubbing operations. 
This includes lines where mocking frameworks or libraries (like unittest.mock in Python, Mockito in Java, Sinon in JavaScript, or similar) are used.
The returned result should be an array containing the relevant lines of code (e.g., ['mocking code line 01', ...]). If no mocking code is found, return an empty array []. 
The solution should be designed to work across various programming languages and code inputs.
Do not provide any additional explanation or analysis in the output, just the list of mocking-related lines.
